+ Cooldown for player jump input

+ Play sound when player does jump input

+ Puffer fish:
  + swims around I guess?
    + flip x-axis when swimming left

  + becomes bigger when player in range
    + step 2: becomes bigger only when player in front

- Submarine:
  - Pickups; you swim over them and add them to inventory	
  - When you have a pickup and swim by the submarine, you drop the pickup
  - Keep count of number of pickups?

  (Probably three scripts, some might just be tags idk; PlayerInventory, Pickup, Submarine)
  (Probably solve this with OnTriggerEnter2D, colliders)

Menu Level!
  + Play game button goes to main scene
  - Add textures

In-game menu:
  + Open (SetActive?) when you press escape (or something)
  + Has button to quit (goes to menu level)

Bugs
	- Reset button not working
